"""Read-time cost lookup for cairn's token-metering feature. stdlib only.

Prices come from the checked-in `prices.json` table (model -> $/MTok for
input, output, cache_read, cache_write_5m, cache_write_1h) and are applied
here at READ time only, never baked into `calls`/`tool_uses` rows at write
time — a price update is a data edit to `prices.json`, never a migration.
Design: docs/features/token-metering/03-architecture.md's Capture side
("Prices are looked up at read time...").

An unrecognized model reports cost "unknown" for that call. A rollup group
containing any unpriced model reports cost None for the whole group — never
a silently-partial sum.

Usage:
    import pricing
    pricing.call_cost(row)     # float, or the string "unknown"
    pricing.group_cost(rows)   # float, or None if any row is unpriced
